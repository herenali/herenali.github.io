Hello! I'm Herena Li, a developer and artist from Hong Kong. I'm currently specialising in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics at the University of Toronto.

## Interests

I'm still relatively new to programming, but right now I'm most interested in web development! Other than that, I'm interested in learning more about natural language processing (NLP).

Outside of computer science, I like drawing and doing digital art! I'm familiar with various digital art programs, like Adobe Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint and Procreate.

## Fun Facts

I'm a big fan of Hello Kitty! I'm also into anime and manga. My latest obsession is the Japanese mobile game Promise of Wizard, which is receiving an anime adaptation soon!
