## TL;DR

The Critter Creator is a simple dress-up game where players can design their own critter, made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. All assets in the game were made by me! Try it out for yourself [here](https://critter-creator.surge.sh/), or check out the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/herenali/critter-creator).

## Critter Creator: Origins

The Critter Creator is basically my own version of a [Picrew](https://picrew.me/en). If you don't know what Picrew is, it is a website that allows people to create and upload their own image makers, which are referred to as "Picrews". Creators can then share their Picrews to the world and let anyone play around with it! That might sound a bit confusing, but a Picrew is really just a dress-up game with less limitations.

I've fiddled around with the website before, and it's honestly really fun! Some really talented artists have made Picrews and they look simply amazing. There are also some cute and interesting Picrews, like [this one](https://picrew.me/en/image_maker/2075394) which lets you customize your own animal-themed cream soda! Picrew is an amazing website, and I really recommend checking it out if you ever need visuals for an original character! Just be sure to check the persmissions set by the creator of each Picrew before you use or share your newly created image.

As a beginner developer, I wanted to get my hands dirty and really start work on a personal project. However, I quickly ran into a problem known as **tutorial hell**. 

## Creating the assets

I first drew out a mockup of the website in Procreate.

One thing that surprised me about 

## The coding process



## Deployment

When I searched up ways to deploy a static website, tons of options popped up. However, the one that stood out to me was Surge due to its ease of use. 

## Final thoughts

If I could start over again, there are lots of things about the code that I would change. But I also see that as a good thing - I know I definitely learned something from this project!
